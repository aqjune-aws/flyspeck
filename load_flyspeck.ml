(* Loading general/audit_formal_proof.hl proves the main theorems in
   "A formal proof of the Kepler conjecture".

   Using the statements below, you can explore the main theorems
   having `the_kepler_conjecture` as a conclusion but with different
   assumptions. *)

(* Loading the main statement without linear program bounds.  It ends at
   The_main_statement.kepler_conjecture_with_assumptions,

     |- !a. tame_classification a /\ good_linear_programming_results a /\
            the_nonlinear_inequalities
            ==> the_kepler_conjecture

   which is the proof with all three of its inputs still assumed. *)

(* Loading the main statement with linear program bounds.  Verifying them
   discharges good_linear_programming_results for the archive, so this ends at
   The_kepler_conjecture.tame_nonlinear_imp_kepler_conjecture,

     |- import_tame_classification /\ the_nonlinear_inequalities
        ==> the_kepler_conjecture *)
(*
build_to_full "general/the_kepler_conjecture.hl";;

(* The whole proof, which also imports the nonlinear inequalities and so needs
   the files after general/the_kepler_conjecture.hl in the sequence.  Those add
   Mk_all_ineq.the_nonlinear_inequalities, |- the_nonlinear_inequalities, which
   discharges the second antecedent above:

     REWRITE_RULE [Mk_all_ineq.the_nonlinear_inequalities]
       The_kepler_conjecture.tame_nonlinear_imp_kepler_conjecture

     |- import_tame_classification ==> the_kepler_conjecture

   What is left assumed is the classification of tame hypermaps, which is
   verified in Isabelle rather than here.  The nonlinear inequalities are
   imported against their digests, so this rests on the deserialization axiom
   as well as HOL Light's own three. *)
